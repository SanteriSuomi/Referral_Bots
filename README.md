# ReferralBots

Bot(s) for automatising referrals for contests on platforms such as SweepWidget. Originally created to easily get referral points for cryptocurrency whitelist contests. 
At the moment of writing this, able to handle most types of SweepWidget "anti-bot" methods such as email verification. Does sometimes get caught in anti-spam filter, but this is likely 
unavoidable. The bot keeps trying until it completes the amount of referrals you want to give to the user specified.

Prerequisites for SweepWidget bot:
- Firefox and GeckoDriver installed
- Private Internet Access installed
- Anti-captcha extension installed
- Random user-agent extension installed
- Bunch of Python libraries installed
